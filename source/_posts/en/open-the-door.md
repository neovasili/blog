I haven't written for a long time, and it's a shame, because it's one of those things that just come out of me, that comfort me and that also serve to satisfy my limitless thirst for knowledge. And what better way to return it than to undertake a new adventure that at the same time helps me to continue developing my technical skills.

I've been thinking about the matter for a long time. My [previous blog](http://paraquepensarlo.blogspot.com) I used it as a vehicle to twist my thoughts, with a clearly air of reflection and philosophy (I'll leave it open in case I decide to write there again), but above all to write, that great unknown ability for many and that brings so much benefit. I don't mean just hitting on the keyboard, but the complex task of transforming thoughts into written words trying to reflect everything. It is not as easy as it looks.

Anyway, what has been on my mind for a long time is not only giving free rein to the keys, but, quoting some of the phrases of [@david_bonilla](https://twitter.com/david_bonilla) from one of his speechs: "_give back to the community a part of what the community has given to me_".

Along this path, I considered writing in a medium with typical repercussions, as a medium. But after giving it a lot of thought, I decided to jump into the pool generating my own blog, in my own way, with the tools I have and learning along the way, of course.

You may be wondering why **the brick code**, and why the image at the top of this article. Very simple, I am passionate about _lego_ and it occurred to me that it would be a great idea to combine my passion for these toys with my passion for creating code. In the end, they are not so different things: you have a series of pieces and you build things from "nothing".

I do not intend to lecture on anything, or become a guru, or anything like that, just tell you from a technical perspective (and sometimes not so much) the things that I have been doing since I was involved in this technology, the mistakes that I have made (which are many) and the things that I have learned along the way.

Not everything will be based on past experiences, since I have a long way to go, so I will try to share new things that I discover and projects that I embark on.

Although I explain it in the section [about me](/about) you will be able to elucidate as the words slip that I am deeply into the deepest part of web technology, systems architecture, infrastructure and backend, especially, but surely many things will also come from other parts of the web technology stack.

I still have a lot to build, many pieces to put together and many doors to open.

Welcome to hell, rookie ;)
