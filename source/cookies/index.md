This blog is personal, I write in it for informative purposes about my experiences and learnings in the world of web development and technology in general so I don't need your data at all, you can rest easy ;)

However, they oblige me to inform you of the obviousness that this blog uses cookies and what they are. This is quite absurd because unless I have manually implemented (which I have not done) some personalized cookie, it is easy to discover which cookies are being installed and search for information about them. Any browser today has some mechanism to see what cookies are stored when you are on a certain page. For example:
*  [Google chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/storage/cookies)
*  [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Storage_Inspector)
*  [Safari](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/295970/how-can-i-check-the-cookie-in-the-safari)

Basically what you can find are the google analytics cookies and the component I use for comments.

As these are third-party cookies and these can change over time, I would not want to waste time trying to explain each and every one of the cookies that there are and be aware of modifying them when they change, so I will make a brief explanation of both blocks and I will tell you where you can go further on the subject.

## Google analytics

As you surely know, google analytics is mainly used to track the users who arrive at a web page by counting how many times and when they visit it. Thus, I can obtain statistics of the people who come to my blog and where they come from. What are the most visited posts, or if what I write reaches more or fewer people, some **web analytics**, go. In short, if it makes sense what I am doing and how I do it.

You can have more details of the specific cookies that are created and their usefulness on the official google page for this: [Cookies google analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage?hl=es-419).

## Disqus (comments component)

Disqus, like google analytics, is a third party component that I have decided to install on my blog to make things easier. It is used to introduce comments on the posts of a static web page (like this one), but for this, some things from the other provider have to be loaded and it also allows you to be identified to make comments, so other typical cookies could be installed, like those of twitter, google accounts or facebook.

In any case, at the end of each article you have the comments section and in it, the link with the disqus privacy policy appears, which contains the information related to cookies. However, I leave you here the direct link: [Cookies disqus](https://disqus.com/data-sharing-settings/).
